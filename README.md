# Cyclistic-Case-Study-with-R-
This is a case study project named 'Cyclistic bike-share analysis' as Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project.
This project is carried out by using R programming language and includes the following steps of the data analysis process:
Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share and Act.
This data has been proposed by Motivate International Inc.

The objective of this Case Study is to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. Cyclistic executives will go through the resulting recommendations for action, which should be relied on compelling data insights and professional data visualizations. Thus, as per the obtained insights, the marketing team will design a new strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

The time period under consideration for this analysis is from September 01, 2021 to August 31, 2022.
